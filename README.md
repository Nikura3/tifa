# TIFA: Accurate and Interpretable Text-to-Image Faithfulness Evaluation with Question Answering

#### What is TIFA?
Images synthesized by text-to-image models (e.g. Stable Diffusion) often do not follow the text inputs well.
TIFA is a simple tool to evaluate the fine-grained alignment between the text and the image.
This repository contains the code and models for our paper [TIFA: Accurate and Interpretable Text-to-Image Faithfulness Evaluation with Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11897). This paper is also accepted to [ICCV 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Hu_TIFA_Accurate_and_Interpretable_Text-to-Image_Faithfulness_Evaluation_with_Question_Answering_ICCV_2023_paper.html). Please refer to the [project page](https://tifa-benchmark.github.io/) for a quick overview.

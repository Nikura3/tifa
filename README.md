# TIFA: Accurate and Interpretable Text-to-Image Faithfulness Evaluation with Question Answering

#### What is TIFA?
Images synthesized by text-to-image models (e.g. Stable Diffusion) often do not follow the text inputs well.
TIFA is a simple tool to evaluate the fine-grained alignment between the text and the image.
This repository contains the code and models for our paper [TIFA: Accurate and Interpretable Text-to-Image Faithfulness Evaluation with Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11897). This paper is also accepted to [ICCV 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Hu_TIFA_Accurate_and_Interpretable_Text-to-Image_Faithfulness_Evaluation_with_Question_Answering_ICCV_2023_paper.html). Please refer to the [project page](https://tifa-benchmark.github.io/) for a quick overview.

#### Do I need OpenAI API to run TIFA?
No. We have pre-generated the questions with OpenAI APIs, such that users only need to run the VQA models in this repo to benchmark their text-to-image models. In addition, this repo also provide tools to generate your own questions with GPT-3.5

#### Why TIFA?
TIFA is much more accurate than CLIP, while being fine-grained and interpretable. It is an ideal choice for fine-grained automatic evaluation of image generation. Meanwhile, this repo also provides tools to allow users to customize their own TIFA benchmark.

## Installation

Clone and build the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yushi-Hu/tifa.git
cd tifa
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

To benchmark your own text-to-image model:

Suppose we are benchmarking on the text inputs in `sample/sample_text_inputs.json`. The questions are in `sample/sample_question_answers.json`.

1. Generate the images from `sample/sample_text_inputs.json`. We have included sample images in `sample/`
2. Make a JSON file that points out the location of each image. We include an example `sample/sample_imgs.json`. The format is like:
```json
{
    "coco_301091": "coco_301091.jpg",
    "drawbench_52": "drawbench_52.jpg"
}
```
3. Run the following code. The output is in `sample/sample_evaluation_result.json`.

```python
from tifascore import tifa_score_benchmark
import json

# We recommend using mplug-large
results = tifa_score_benchmark("mplug-large", "sample/sample_question_answers.json", "sample/sample_imgs.json")

# save the results
with open("sample/sample_evaluation_result.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=4)
```

### Benchmark on TIFA v1.0 benchmark
To evaluate on TIFA v1.0 benchmark, generate images for text inputs in `tifa_v1.0/tifa_v1.0_text_inputs.json`. and run
```python
results = tifa_score_benchmark("mplug-large", "tifa_v1.0/tifa_v1.0_question_answers.json", "[YOUR IMAGE PATH]")

# save the results
with open("results.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=4)
```


## TIFA v1.0 Benchmark

TIFA v1.0 text inputs are in `tifa_v1.0/tifa_v1.0_text_inputs.json`

The GPT-3 pre-generated TIFA v1.0 question and answers are in `tifa_v1.0/tifa_v1.0_question_answers.json`.

## TIFA v1.0 Human Annotations
We release the human annotations on text-to-image faithufulness in `human_annotations` to facilitate future research in this direction. Refer to the readme in the directory for details.


## VQA Modules

We provide easy interface to run VQA inference. The supported image-to-text models include `mplug-large, git-base, git-large, blip-base, blip-large, vilt, ofa-large, promptcap-t5large, blip2-flant5xl`. You can also customize your own VQA models in `tifascore/vqa_models.py`.

To peform inference

```python
from tifascore import VQAModel

# automatically on GPU if detect CUDA.
# support all above VQA models. Here we use mplug-large as an example.
model = VQAModel("mplug-large")

# perform free-form VQA
print(model.vqa("sample/drawbench_8.jpg", "What is the fruit?"))
# bananas

# perform multiple-choice VQA
print(model.multiple_choice_vqa("sample/drawbench_8.jpg", "What is the color of the banana?", choices=['black', 'yellow', 'red', 'green']))
# {'free_form_answer': 'yellow', 'multiple_choice_answer': 'yellow'}
```
In this example, the image is <img src="sample/drawbench_8.jpg" width="60">. The answer to `what is the fruit?` is `bananas`, and the answer to `what is the color of the banana?` is `yellow`.

## Question Generation Modules

TIFA allows users to generate questions on their own text inputs. The question generation contains two part. First is question generation with GPT-3. And then we filter the questions with UnifiedQA.
We will release a fine-tuned Flan-T5 model so that the users can generate questions locally without OpenAI API. However, the question quality will be lower than GPT-3 generated ones.

### Question generation with GPT-3.5

Notice that since code-davinci-002 is deprecated, we rewrite our code with gpt-3.5-turbo. Since the input length limit is 4097, which is smaller than Codex's, we reduce the number of in-context examples in the current codebase. Thus, the questions will be slightly different from the ones in TIFA v1.0 benchmark.

```python
import openai
from tifascore import get_question_and_answers

openai.api_key = "[Your OpenAI Key]"

text = "a black colored banana."
gpt3_questions = get_question_and_answers(text)
# gpt3_questions is a list of question answer pairs with the same format as sample/sample_question_answers.json
```

### Question generation with LLaMA 2

We also provide an alternative way to generate questions using our fine-tuned LLaMA 2. The question quality are similar to the GPT-3 generated ones, and it is fully open and reproducible. The huggingface link is <https://huggingface.co/tifa-benchmark/llama2_tifa_question_generation/>

```python
from tifascore import get_llama2_pipeline, get_llama2_question_and_answers

pipeline = get_llama2_pipeline("tifa-benchmark/llama2_tifa_question_generation")

llama2_questions = get_llama2_question_and_answers(pipeline, "a black colored banana.")
# llama2_questions has the same format as the gpt3_questions
```

### Filter with UnifiedQA

To double-check the questions, we also run UnifiedQA to filter GPT-3 generated questions.

```python
import openai
from tifascore import UnifiedQAModel, filter_question_and_answers

unifiedqa_model = UnifiedQAModel("allenai/unifiedqa-v2-t5-large-1363200")

# filter gpt3_questions
filtered_questions = filter_question_and_answers(unifiedqa_model, gpt3_questions)
```

## TIFA on arbitrary image and text

Combining above modules, we can compute TIFA on arbitary image-text pair.

```python
from tifascore import get_question_and_answers, filter_question_and_answers, UnifiedQAModel, tifa_score_single, VQAModel
import openai

openai.api_key = "[Your OpenAI Key]"
unifiedqa_model = UnifiedQAModel("allenai/unifiedqa-v2-t5-large-1363200")
vqa_model = VQAModel("mplug-large")
    
    
img_path = "sample/drawbench_8.jpg"
text = "a black colored banana."
    
# Generate questions with GPT-3.5-turbo
gpt3_questions = get_question_and_answers(text)
    
# Filter questions with UnifiedQA
filtered_questions = filter_question_and_answers(unifiedqa_model, gpt3_questions)
    
# See the questions
print(filtered_questions)

# calucluate TIFA score
result = tifa_score_single(vqa_model, filtered_questions, img_path)
print(f"TIFA score is {result['tifa_score']}")   # 0.33
print(result)
```

In this example, TIFA score between the text `a black colored banana` and <img src="sample/drawbench_8.jpg" width="60"> is 0.33.
